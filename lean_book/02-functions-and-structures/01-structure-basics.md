## `structure`: bundling data together

---

A `structure` groups several pieces of data under one name. We will use
this Lean feature constantly once we define groups and rings.

```lean
structure Point where
  x : Nat
  y : Nat

def origin : Point := { x := 0, y := 0 }

#eval origin.x        -- 0
```

Key points:

- `Point.mk` is the automatically generated **constructor**. This is the
  function that actually builds a `Point` out of an `x` and a `y`. `{ x :=
  ..., y := ... }` is shorthand for `Point.mk ... ...`. It names each field
  so the order cannot be mixed up.
- There is an even shorter way to write this: `⟨0, 0⟩` builds the exact
  same `Point`. It simply lists the values in field-declaration order
  instead of naming them. Read `⟨_, _⟩` as **"here are the pieces, in
  order — the constructor is to be inferred from context."** Lean can
  always determine it, because the *expected type* (here, `Point`, from
  `def origin : Point := ...`) indicates exactly which constructor and
  which fields must be filled in. This is also where the official name
  comes from: it is called the **anonymous constructor**, because
  `Point.mk` is never written explicitly — it remains anonymous, and Lean
  infers it from context. `⟨_, _⟩` recurs constantly from Chapter 3
  onward, for proofs as much as for data.
- `p.x` is **field projection** notation, shorthand for `Point.x p`.
  `origin.x` above is exactly this projection applied to `origin`.

```lean
def shift (p : Point) (dx dy : Nat) : Point :=
  { x := p.x + dx, y := p.y + dy }

#eval (shift origin 3 4).y   -- 4
```

`shift` shows a structure used on *both* sides of a function: it takes a
`Point` in (reading its fields back out with the same `p.x`/`p.y`
projection notation) and builds a new one via `{ x := ..., y := ... }`,
the same field-naming syntax `origin` used above.

Note also that structures can bundle *proofs* alongside data, not just
data. This is exactly how a group will be defined later — a carrier type,
an operation, and proofs that the operation satisfies the group axioms,
all in one `structure`.

**Mathematical reading.** `structure Point where x : Nat; y : Nat` is the
Cartesian product $\mathrm{Point} = \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$, with `x`
and `y` playing the role of the two projections
$\pi_1, \pi_2 : \mathrm{Point} \to \mathbb{N}$. Here `p.x` computes
$\pi_1(p)$, `p.y` computes $\pi_2(p)$, and `{ x := ..., y := ... }` builds
an element via the universal property of the product (a pair of maps into
the factors determines a unique map into the product). More generally, a
`structure` with fields of types $A_1, \ldots, A_n$ is the $n$-fold product
$A_1 \times \cdots \times A_n$. Once fields are allowed to be *proofs*
(propositions), the same construction becomes a **subset cut out by
conditions**: a structure `{ data : D, proof : P data }` is the dependent
pair (subset) $\{\, d \in D \mid P(d) \,\}$, categorically a subobject of
$D$.
