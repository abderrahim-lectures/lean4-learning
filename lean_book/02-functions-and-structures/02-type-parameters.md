## Structures with type parameters

```lean
structure Pair (α β : Type) where
  fst : α
  snd : β

def p : Pair Nat String := { fst := 1, snd := "one" }

#eval p.fst    -- 1
#eval p.snd     -- "one"
```

This generalizes directly to how we will write, e.g., `structure Group (α : Type)`.

**Mathematical reading.** `Pair α β` is the ordinary binary Cartesian
product, but taken *uniformly*, as a functor of two arguments at once.
Rather than fixing $\alpha$ and $\beta$ once, `structure Pair (α β : Type)
where ...` defines the *whole family* of products $\alpha \times \beta$ at
once, one for every choice of the two type arguments. `Pair Nat String`
is then just this construction evaluated at the pair $(\mathbb{N},
\mathrm{String})$, giving $\mathbb{N} \times \mathrm{String}$. This is the
same "definition parameterized by objects of the category" idea that lets
us later write `Group (G : Type)`: not one group, but the functor sending
a carrier type $G$ to the type of group-structures on $G$.

**Programmer's corner (Python).** Python code like `def identity(x): return
x` or `class Pair: def __init__(self, fst, snd): ...` is also "generic" in
the sense that it does not mention any particular type. Nothing checks
that genericity until the code actually runs, however. Writing
`identity(3) + "oops"` causes Python to happily run `identity`, hand back
`3`, and only then break on `3 + "oops"` at runtime. Constructing a `Pair`
and placing a `Group (Fin 3)` into its `fst` draws no complaint from
Python. The closer analogue is `typing.TypeVar`: `def identity(x: T) -> T:
return x` *documents* the same universally quantified type `identity` has
in Lean, but that annotation is optional, erased at runtime, and enforced
only if a checker such as `mypy` is separately run — and nothing stops a
stray `# type: ignore` from silencing it. Lean's `{α : Type} → α → α` is
not documentation: it is *proved*, once, that `identity` works for every
type `α`, and that proof is checked before `identity` is ever called. It
is not merely approximated by a linter that might go unrun.
